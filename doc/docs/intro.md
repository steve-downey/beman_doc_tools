# Intro

The Beman Doc Tools project helps create documentation for a Beman Project
library.  It is based on [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), and uses
[Doxygen](https://doxygen.nl/) ->
[Moxygen](https://github.com/sourcey/moxygen) to generate API docs in Markdown
(Beman docs are written in Markdown).
